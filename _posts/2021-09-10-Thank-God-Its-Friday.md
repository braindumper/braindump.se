Sitting in the Sofa with some snacks and a beer, it's been a really intense week!
My oldest daughter is at a sleep over party with friends and youngest one is going to a birthday party tomorrow, so right now it looks like a pretty relaxed weekend.

This week has been really intensive, my goal is to find more balance in my life.
That's why I went from a 100% consultant assignment to 50%, to be able to focus on my startups, internal work, health and family.
One of my biggest interests is about productivity and self-improvement, the goal is to enjoy and use my time in a more intentionful way.
Not just maximizing income or looking good at work, it's just as important to get quality time with the family.
I just don't want to *waste* time on binge looking on Netflix, if I don't think it will bring value to myself or someone close to me.

So far this blog has just been on writing down what pops up in my head at the end of the day, dumping my brain.
Another part is to add more quality and structured guides in problems that I run in to my daily life.

It's friday, really time to kickback with the family!

Ps. Another *goal* is to never spend more than 10 minutes on each blog post.

Have a great Weekend!!!
