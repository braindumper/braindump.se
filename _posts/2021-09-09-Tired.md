The alarm clock goes of at 6:45 a.m, feeling like I have been out partying all night!
My wife already went to the gym, so I wake up the kids and walk out to the kitchen for a double coffee.

**Thank** god for coffee, almost feeling like a human again!

Dropping of the kids at school and then heading over to our consultant office.
Today i'm off my assignment so planning to do some internal work, getting [www.braindump.se](www.braindump.se) up and running and hopefully get some stuff done with the Flutter project.

* Going over some financial stuff
* Having a workshop regarding activities and goals for our continues learning initiative
* Discussing Christmas party & spring conference (always feels weird to do it this early, but it's a must)

### Braindump.se
#### Steps to get a basic site up
##### Domain
So yesterday night I bought the domain great!
I wen't with [Simply](www.simply.com) because it was cheapest and got good ratings.
##### Email account
I want email accounts linked to @braindump.se so I easily can communicate with readers in the future.
Unfortunately the subscription I signed up for at [Simply](www.simply.com) doesn't include any email, only domain registration and DNS.
Since I been around for a while I signed up for GSuite when it was released and free, and actually for early adopters you get it for free for "life".
With GSuite it's easy to add an additional domain and then I have my email account.
##### Github Pages
Signing up for a free github account with my new email.
Github pages are driven by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it's a good idea to check it out.
Github have good guides how to get started, one of the things you need to do is select a Theme. The theme will control the layout and visualisation of your site.
There is a couple of themes you can select directly from inside the Github pages settings.

I googled around for nice looking themes with good ratings and ended up with [Minimal misstakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
[Minimal misstakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) has a really nice way of getting started quickly by just clicking [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) generator.
When I had generated my site I only need to head in to the settings page and enable Github pages and now it showed up on a github.io address.
Of course, I want the page to be hosted on my newly bought domain [www.braindump.se](www.braindump.se). I did that by following the instructions on Github for configuring my dns records.
Eg. adding C-name and A records.

When I had completed these steps I was able to see my new page on [www.braindump.se](www.braindump.se).

I also installed [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) locally on my machine so i'm able to preview the site before publishing my changes.

Phew, rushed home again, ate dinner with the family, attended a startup meeting for youngest daughter's soccer team and ended up as assisting soccer coach (hardly ever played soccer).
Putting the girls to bed and wrote this post and pushed it to github.

The site is **LIVE**!!!

Time to end the evening with a last meeting going through the last months sale and plan for the coming months for my second startup.

Really looking forward to get a good nights sleep.
